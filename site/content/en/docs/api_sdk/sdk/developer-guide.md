## Overview

This package contains manually written and generated files. We store only sources in
the repository. To get the full package, one need to generate missing package files.

## Package file layout

- `gen/` - generator files
- `cvat_sdk/` - Python package root
- `cvat_sdk/api_client` - autogenerated low-level package code
- `cvat_sdk/core` - high-level package code

## How to generate package code

1. Obtain the server API schema

If you have a local custom version of the server, run the following command in the terminal.
You need to be able to execute django server. Server installation instructions are available
[here](/contributing/development-environment).
```bash
mkdir -p cvat-sdk/schema/ && python manage.py spectacular --file cvat-sdk/schema/schema.yml
```

If you want to use docker instead:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml run \
    --no-deps --entrypoint '/usr/bin/env python' --rm -u "$(id -u)":"$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":"/local" \
    cvat_server \
    manage.py spectacular --file /local/cvat-sdk/schema/schema.yml
```

If you don't have access to the server sources, but have a working instance,
you can also get schema from `<yourserver>/api/docs`:

2. Install generator dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r gen/requirements.txt
```

3. Generate package code (call from the package root directory!):
```bash
./gen/generate.sh
```

4. To allow editing of the package, install it with `pip install -e cvat-sdk/`.

## How to edit templates

If you want to edit templates, obtain them from the generator first:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/local \
    openapitools/openapi-generator-cli author template \
        -o /local/generator_templates -g python
```

Then, you can copy the modified version of the template you need into
the `gen/templates/openapi-generator/` directory.

## How to test

API client tests are integrated into REST API tests in `/tests/python/rest_api`
and SDK tests are placed next to them in `/tests/python/sdk`.
To execute, run:
```bash
pytest tests/python/rest_api tests/python/sdk
```
